    **Preface

    Instead of letting external factors govern the state of our software architecture, this book takes the stance of taking control ourselves. We gain this control by creating an architecture that makes the software soft, as in “flexible”, “extensible” and “adaptable”. Such an architecture will make it easy to react to external factors and take a lot of pressure from our backs.

    **What Is the Goal of This Book?
        --provide ane interpretation about how to implement Hexagonal Architecture
